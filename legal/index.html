        <h1>koopie - Privacy Policy & Terms of Service</h1>

        <section id="privacy-policy">
            <h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
            <p>This Privacy Policy explains how koopie ("the Bot") collects, uses, and discloses information when you use our services on Discord.</p>

            <h3>1. Data Collection</h3>
            <p>The Bot collects the following types of information:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>User IDs:</strong> We collect User IDs of users who interact with the Bot. This is necessary for the Bot's functionality, such as identifying users for commands, permissions, or storing user-specific settings.</li>
                <li><strong>Guild (Server) IDs:</strong> We collect Guild IDs of the Discord servers the Bot is in. This is necessary to operate the Bot within those servers and to store server-specific configurations (e.g., custom prefixes, welcome messages, logging channel settings).</li>
                <li><strong>Channel IDs:</strong> We may collect Channel IDs for specific features, such as setting up logging channels, designated command channels, or announcement channels.</li>
                <li><strong>Message Content (Limited):</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Direct Interactions:</strong> The Bot processes your message content when you directly interact with it (e.g., using slash commands, mentioning the bot, or sending messages in designated channels). This content is processed solely to fulfill your command or request and is generally not stored persistently unless explicitly required for a specific feature (e.g., if you use a "note-taking" command, the note content might be stored).</li>
                        <li><strong>Logging/Moderation (Opt-in/Configurable):</strong> If a server administrator enables specific logging or moderation features, the Bot might process and potentially temporarily store message content, user IDs, and channel IDs for the purpose of maintaining server logs or enforcing server rules. This functionality is <strong>opt-in</strong> and configurable by server administrators.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Voice Activity (If Applicable):</strong> If the Bot joins voice channels (e.g., for music playback or voice moderation features), it may temporarily process voice data. This data is processed in real-time and is <strong>never</strong> recorded or stored by the Bot.</li>
                <li><strong>User-Provided Data (Opt-in/Configurable):</strong> The Bot may store data that users explicitly provide for specific features (e.g., custom role assignments, game statistics, reminder content, user-specific settings). This data is stored only with your consent through your interaction with the respective command.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>2. How We Use Information</h3>
            <p>The information collected by the Bot is used solely for the following purposes:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>To provide and operate the Bot's intended features and services.</li>
                <li>To respond to your commands and requests.</li>
                <li>To maintain server-specific configurations and settings.</li>
                <li>To improve the Bot's functionality and user experience (e.g., error reporting).</li>
                <li>For moderation and logging features, as configured by server administrators.</li>
                <li>To comply with Discord's Terms of Service and Developer Policy.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>3. Data Storage and Retention</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>User IDs, Guild IDs, and Channel IDs are stored for as long as the Bot is in a server or as long as a feature requiring their storage is active.</li>
                <li>Message content processed for command fulfillment is generally not stored persistently.</li>
                <li>User-provided data is stored until the user or a server administrator explicitly requests its deletion or removes the corresponding feature.</li>
                <li>Data collected for logging/moderation features is retained as configured by the server administrator or for a limited period necessary for the feature's operation.</li>
                <li>Voice data (if applicable) is processed in real-time and not stored.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>4. Data Sharing and Disclosure</h3>
            <p>The Bot does not share any collected data with third parties, except in the following limited circumstances:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>With Discord:</strong> Information is shared with Discord's API as necessary to operate the Bot (e.g., sending messages, managing roles).</li>
                <li><strong>Legal Requirements:</strong> If required by law or valid legal process.</li>
                <li><strong>Service Providers (If Applicable):</strong> If the Bot uses third-party services (e.g., a database provider, an external API for specific features), data may be temporarily processed by these services to fulfill the Bot's functions. We strive to use providers with strong data privacy practices. (e.g., Cloudflare)</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>5. Your Rights and Choices</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Access and Deletion:</strong> You can request access to or deletion of your personal data stored by the Bot. Please contact <a href="https://discord.gg/KPbRRPv9jU">our support server</a> or email us at <a href="mailto:rekushii@icloud.com">rekushii@icloud.com</a>. For server-specific data, server administrators may have tools to manage or delete it.</li>
                <li><strong>Opt-Out:</strong> You can remove the Bot from your server at any time, which will result in the deletion of most server-specific data within 1 day.</li>
                <li><strong>Server Administrator Control:</strong> Server administrators have control over most data collected within their servers through the Bot's configuration commands.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>6. Data Security</h3>
            <p>We implement reasonable technical and organizational measures to protect the information collected by the Bot from unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure, or destruction. However, no method of transmission over the internet or method of electronic storage is 100% secure.</p>

            <h3>7. Age Limitations</h3>
            <p>The Bot is intended for users who are at least 13 years old, in accordance with Discord's Terms of Service. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If we become aware that we have collected personal information from a child under 13, we will take steps to delete such information.</p>

            <h3>8. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h3>
            <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on <a href="https://discord.gg/KPbRRPv9jU">discord.gg/KPbRRPv9jU</a>. Your continued use of the Bot after any changes constitutes your acceptance of the new Privacy Policy.</p>
